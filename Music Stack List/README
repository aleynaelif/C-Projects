Necil Kazım         Akses               İkinci Senfoni          90

Create a stack that is implemented with a linked list. You must define struct person like;
struct person{
 name (char[]);
 surname (char[]);
 musical_Work(char[]);
 age(int);
 struct person *next;
} *top;

In your program, you have to create a menu which has the following operations.

1- Add a Person to the Stack
Take person’s information with scanf, create a node and add the node to the stack using the function
addNode(char name[], char surname [], char creation [], int age).

2- Pop a Person from the Stack
Delete the last node of the stack. Create deleteNode(…) to pop a node.

3- Sort in Alphabetical Order
Write a method Sort_Alphabetically(…) to order the names of the people in the stack alphabetically. 
Use the print_stack(…) method to show the sorted stack.

4- Sort Age in Increasing Order
Write a method Sort_Increasingly(…) that sorts ages of people in the stack in increasing order. Use 
the print_stack(…) method to show the sorted stack.

5- Exit menu
Quit menu.
