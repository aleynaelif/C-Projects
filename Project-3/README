1) Write a code which should perform the following operations. It has to take two numbers from 
user and find multipliers of numbers with a common() function . 
For example; Factors of 24 {2,2,2,3}
 Factors of 32 {2,2,2,2,2}
Then calculate the common factors recursively which are {2,2,2} and function has to return 2*2*2.
2) Write a code which should perform the following operations. User should enter the length of list 
and list elements like the list. You can take the list of numbers in the main function.
For example;
Enter the length of the list: 10
Enter the elements of list: 
3
9
23
1
8
22
67
0
16
52
Then you should create a function that takes the numbers and show the new list with increasing 
order. Function has to divide the list into two lists recursively until it can no more be divided. After 
that it combines all elements with increasing order. Output of the program should be like:
Sorted array is :0 1 3 8 9 16 22 23 52 67.
3) Write a code which should perform the following operations. User should enter an input 
number. Then create a function which will calculate the output numbers recursively using 
following formula.
For example; Input: 45
Output: 45 136 68 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
4) Write a code which should perform the following operations. User should enter a number and 
the code has to check if the number fits the formula or not . Create a function which is checking the 
input number recursively. Function should gives results “equal” or “Not Equal”

F(x)= (𝒆𝒒𝒖𝒂𝒍, 𝒁𝑿𝑪𝑽 = 𝒁^𝑵 + 𝑿^𝑵 + 𝑪^𝑵 + 𝑽^𝑵
       𝒏𝒐𝒕 𝒆𝒒𝒖𝒂𝒍, 𝒁𝑿𝑪𝑽 ≠ 𝒁^𝑵 + 𝑿^𝑵 + 𝑪^𝑵 + 𝑽^N) N=number of digit
       
example: Input=371
Output: Equal
Input=372
Output: Not Equal

5) Write a code which should perform the following operations. User should enter a string without 
space and code should find the first capital letter in the string. You have to write a function which 
finds the letter recursively.
Input: computerScienceAndEnginnering
Output:S
